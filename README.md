Tip calculator app

![Design preview for the Tip calculator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

A simple tip calculator app I built for a Frontend Mentor challenge. It's one of my earliest projects and I'm pretty pleased with how it turned out. It's built in plain HTML/CSS/Javascript, all coded by yours truly. 

Working from the designs provided by Frontend Mentor was a great experience as a newbie. Plus I improved my CSS layout skills and general Javascript by working on this project.
